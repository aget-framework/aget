  # What layer AGET occupies in the stack
  layer: "Governance substrate"
  layer_description: |
    AGET sits above CLI agent platforms (Claude Code, Cursor, Aider) as a
    governance layer. CLI agents are the runtime; AGET is the governance
    substrate that enables consistent behavior across platforms.

  # Strategic Thesis
  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  strategic_thesis:
    statement: |
      CLI agent platforms will evolve governance capabilities independently.
      AGET invests in platform-agnostic patterns that will become universal
      before the platforms converge on them.

    investment_rationale:
      - principle: "Too important not to invest"
        explanation: "Agent governance is critical infrastructure for AI-assisted work"

      - principle: "Wrong to bet on single platform"
        explanation: "Platform landscape is fragmented and evolving rapidly"

      - principle: "Right to invest in governance patterns"
        explanation: "Patterns are portable; platform-specific features are not"

    # What platforms will eventually build (and AGET has now)
    platform_convergence_predictions:
      - capability: "Session protocols"
        aget_implementation: "wake up, wind down, study up, step back"
        platform_equivalent: "Hooks, startup scripts, shutdown handlers"

      - capability: "Memory/context management"
        aget_implementation: "KB as collaboration substrate"
        platform_equivalent: ".claude/, .cursor/rules, memory.md"

      - capability: "Permission governance"
        aget_implementation: "Decision authority matrix, escalation"
        platform_equivalent: "MCP servers, permission prompts"

      - capability: "Multi-agent coordination"
        aget_implementation: "Fleet patterns, supervisor hierarchy"
        platform_equivalent: "Crews (CrewAI), agents (AutoGen)"

    # Correct and incorrect analogies for strategic positioning
    analogies:
      correct:
        - pattern: "TCP/IP over specific networks"
          explanation: "Protocol layer that works across implementations"

        - pattern: "Kubernetes over cloud vendors"
          explanation: "Orchestration layer that abstracts provider differences"

        - pattern: "Web standards over browsers"
          explanation: "Specifications that enable interoperability"

        - pattern: "SQL over database vendors"
          explanation: "Query language that works across implementations"

      incorrect:
        - pattern: "Windows vs Mac platform bet"
          explanation: "AGET is not betting on one runtime to win"

        - pattern: "AWS vs Azure vendor lock-in"
          explanation: "AGET explicitly avoids platform-specific dependencies"

        - pattern: "Facebook vs Twitter social bet"
          explanation: "AGET is infrastructure, not application"

  # Evolution Trajectory
  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  evolution_trajectory:
    description: "How agent terminology and scope has evolved"

    stages:
      - era: "2024"
        term: "Coding Agent"
        scope: "Domain-specific (code tasks)"
        limitation: "Excludes non-code work"
        examples:
          - "GitHub Copilot"
          - "Tabnine"
          - "Early Cursor"

      - era: "2025"
        term: "CLI Agent"
        scope: "Interface-specific (terminal-based)"
        limitation: "Still implies developer focus"
        examples:
          - "Claude Code"
          - "Aider"
          - "Codex CLI"

      - era: "2026"
        term: "Governed Agent"
        scope: "Governance-centric (human-supervised autonomy)"
        limitation: "None identified yet"
        examples:
          - "AGET-managed agents"
          - "Enterprise agentic automation"
          - "Digital coworkers"

    key_insight: |
      The progression abstracts away from domain (coding) and interface (CLI)
      to relationship (governed) and capability (autonomous work within bounds).

  # Competitive Landscape (2026)
  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  competitive_landscape:
    description: "How AGET relates to other frameworks in the 2026 landscape"

    categories:
      - category: "Agent Frameworks"
        examples:
          - "LangChain / LangGraph"
          - "CrewAI"
          - "AutoGen"
        aget_distinction: |
          These frameworks focus on agent orchestration and tool use.
          AGET focuses on governance, session management, and human oversight.
          They are complementary, not competitive.

      - category: "CLI Agent Platforms"
        examples:
          - "Claude Code"
          - "Cursor"
          - "Aider"
        aget_distinction: |
          These are runtime platforms. AGET is a governance layer that
          works across all of them, providing consistent patterns.

      - category: "Enterprise AI Platforms"
        examples:
          - "Microsoft Agent Framework"
          - "Salesforce Einstein"
          - "ServiceNow AI"
        aget_distinction: |
          These are vendor-specific solutions. AGET is open-source and
          platform-agnostic, designed for portability.

market_context:
  year: 2026

  industry_trends:
    - trend: "Agentic AI Adoption"
      source: "Deloitte Tech Trends 2026"
      statistic: "80% of enterprise apps expected to embed agents by 2026"

    - trend: "Human-in-the-Loop"
      source: "Industry consensus"
      insight: |
        The narrative is shifting from viewing human oversight as
        acknowledging AI limitations to designing 'Enterprise Agentic
        Automation' that combines dynamic AI execution with deterministic
        guardrails and human judgment at key decision points.

    - trend: "Governance as Enabler"
      source: "Enterprise adoption patterns"
      insight: |
        Mature governance frameworks increase organizational confidence
        to deploy agents in higher-value scenarios, creating a virtuous
        cycle of trust and capability expansion.
