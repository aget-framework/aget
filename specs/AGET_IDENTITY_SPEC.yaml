    # Full definition - for README, documentation
    full: |
      AGET is a platform-agnostic governance framework for CLI-based human-AI
      agentic work. It provides session continuity, shared memory architecture,
      fleet coordination, and human-supervised autonomy patterns that work
      across AI coding assistants. Validated platforms include Claude Code,
      Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI.

    # Technical definition - for specifications, formal documents
    technical: |
      AGET (Agent Framework) is a configuration and lifecycle management
      specification for CLI-based AI agents operating under human supervision.
      It defines protocols for session management, knowledge persistence,
      multi-agent coordination, and governance boundaries that are portable
      across heterogeneous AI coding assistant platforms.

  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  not_definition:
    - id: NOT-1
      statement: "A specific AI model or runtime"
      clarification: "AGET is a governance layer that works with any LLM backend"

    - id: NOT-2
      statement: "A replacement for Claude Code, Codex CLI, or Gemini CLI"
      clarification: "AGET sits above these platforms as a governance substrate"

      statement: "An autonomous AI system"
      clarification: "AGET explicitly requires human supervision and gate discipline"
