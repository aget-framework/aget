  AGET is a platform-agnostic governance framework for CLI-based human-AI
  agentic work. It provides session continuity, shared memory architecture,
  fleet coordination, and human-supervised autonomy patterns that work
  across AI coding assistants. Validated platforms include Claude Code,
  Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI.
