# AGET v3.4.0 Release Notes

**Release Date**: 2026-01-18 (pending)
**Theme**: Session Skills Maturity + Governance Formalization
**Scope Definition**: VERSION_SCOPE_v3.4.0.md v1.14.0
**Execution**: PROJECT_PLAN_v3.4.0_release_v1.2.md

---

## Executive Summary

AGET v3.4.0 marks a significant maturation of session management capabilities and establishes formal governance patterns across three domains. This release delivers cross-CLI portable session protocols validated on Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI, along with comprehensive governance infrastructure for releases, behavioral patterns, and artifacts.

**Impact**: Agents using v3.4.0 gain:
- Robust session protocols with re-entrancy guards, sanity checks, and calendar awareness
- Formal governance templates for L-docs, Enhancement Requests, and PROJECT_PLANs
- Spec-first documentation enabling machine-readable identity and positioning

## What's New

### Session Skills Maturity

The five core session protocols (wake_up, wind_down, study_up, sanity_check, step_back) have been enhanced and validated for cross-CLI portability:

| Protocol | Enhancement | Spec |
|----------|-------------|------|
| **wind_down.py** | Re-entrancy guard prevents concurrent executions | CAP-SESSION-010 |
| **wind_down.py** | Sanity gate runs abbreviated health check before session end | CAP-SESSION-012 |
| **wake_up.py** | Calendar awareness displays date and release window notifications | CAP-SESSION-011 |

**Cross-CLI Validation**: Session protocols tested and documented on:
- Claude Code (primary target)
- Codex CLI (wrapper script pattern)
- Gemini CLI (preview support, hooks unstable)

### Governance Formalization

Three governance domains now have formal structure:

#### Release Governance

| Artifact | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| VERSION_SCOPE vocabulary | 8 terms formalized in AGET_VOCABULARY_SPEC |
| CAP-REL-012-018 | VERSION_SCOPE requirements in EARS format |
| SOP Phase 2.5 | Vocabulary/spec reconciliation protocol |
| SOP Phase 2.6 | SOP/Template reconciliation protocol |

#### Behavioral Governance

| Artifact | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| L552 | Imperative Escalation Bypass pattern documented |
| R-BEHAV-EAC-* | Behavioral requirements for escalation acknowledgment |

#### Artifact Governance

| Artifact | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| SOP_L-DOC_CREATION.md | Standard procedure for creating L-docs |
| TEMPLATE_L-DOC.md | Reusable L-doc template |
| SOP_ENHANCEMENT_REQUEST.md | Standard procedure for Enhancement Requests |
| TEMPLATE_ENHANCEMENT_REQUEST.md | Reusable Enhancement Request template |
| SOP_project_plan_archival.md | PROJECT_PLAN → evolution workflow (CAP-EVOL-008) |
| TEMPLATE_PROJECT_PLAN.md | Updated with Gate -1, Operational Context, Retrospective |

### Spec-First Documentation

Machine-readable source of truth for public documentation:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| AGET_IDENTITY_SPEC.yaml | Agent identity specification |
| AGET_POSITIONING_SPEC.yaml | Market positioning specification |
| codemeta.json | Software metadata standard |
| CITATION.cff | Citation file format for academic reference |

### Template Infrastructure

All 12 templates now include `sops/` directory scaffold (R-TEMPLATE-001):

```
template-*/
└── sops/
    └── README.md   # SOP directory guidance
```

## Specification Updates

| Spec | Version | Changes |
|------|---------|---------|
| AGET_SESSION_SPEC.md | 1.1.0 → 1.2.0 | CAP-SESSION-010, 011, 012 |
| AGET_PROJECT_PLAN_SPEC.md | 1.1.0 → 1.2.0 | CAP-PP-013 through 018 |
| AGET_TEMPLATE_SPEC.md | 3.3.1 → 3.3.2 | R-TEMPLATE-001 |

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Agents

1. **Update version files**: Bump `.aget/version.json` to 3.4.0
2. **Create sops/ directory**: If not present, create `sops/README.md`
3. **Review session scripts**: Verify wake_up.py and wind_down.py compatibility

### Breaking Changes

None. v3.4.0 is backward compatible with v3.3.x agents.

### Deprecations

None in this release.

## Lessons Learned

Captured during v3.4.0 development:

| L-doc | Summary |
|-------|---------|
| L554 | Hierarchical PROJECT_PLAN gap — SOP needs top-level vs contributing guidance |
| L555-candidate | KB review should precede governance artifact creation |
| L556-candidate | V-tests validate presence, not correctness |
