    Management of the 6-layer memory architecture including domain knowledge,
    organizational context, and experiential learnings.

  memory_layers:
    layer_1_identity:
      location: .aget/identity.json
      description: North Star, purpose, and archetype
      volatility: stable

    layer_2_governance:
      location: governance/
      description: Charter, mission, scope boundaries
      volatility: stable

    layer_3_domain:
      location: .aget/memory/domain/
      description: Domain-specific knowledge
      volatility: grows

    layer_4_organizational:
      location: .aget/memory/organizational/
      description: Organizational context and relationships
      volatility: moderate

    layer_5_experiential:
      location: .aget/memory/experiential/
      description: Session history and learnings
      volatility: grows

    layer_6_session:
      location: planning/
      description: Current session context
      volatility: ephemeral

  operations:
    store:
      - Write to appropriate layer
      - Validate against schema if applicable
    retrieve:
      - Load from layer
      - Apply inheritance chain
    synthesize:
      - Combine layers for context
      - Apply relevance filtering

  requirements:
    - R-MEM-001: Layer separation maintained
    - R-MEM-002: Inheritance chain respected
    - R-MEM-003: Session context recoverable

  theoretical_basis:
    - Extended Mind: KB as cognitive extension
    - Distributed Cognition: Memory across artifacts
    - Transactive Memory: Shared "who knows what"
