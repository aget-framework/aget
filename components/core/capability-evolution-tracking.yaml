  description: |
    Learning document (L-doc) creation and management for capturing insights,
    patterns, and anti-patterns discovered during operation.

  l_doc_structure:
    location: .aget/evolution/
    naming: L{NNN}_{descriptive_name}.md

    sections:
      required:
        - Learning title
        - Context/trigger
        - Observation
        - Evidence
        - Application
      optional:
        - Theoretical basis
        - Related learnings
        - Counter-examples

  behaviors:
    capture_triggers:
      - Unexpected outcome
      - Pattern recognition
      - Anti-pattern identification
      - Process improvement insight
      - Novel solution discovery

    graduation_path:
      local: .aget/evolution/L*.md
      validated: docs/patterns/PATTERN_*.md
      canonical: inherited/

  requirements:
    - R-EVOL-001: L-docs use standard format
    - R-EVOL-002: Evidence required for claims
    - R-EVOL-003: Application section required

  theoretical_basis:
    - Complex Adaptive Systems: Emergence through learning
    - Cybernetics: Feedback loops for improvement
    - Stigmergy: Knowledge artifacts enable coordination
