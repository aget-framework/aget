    Detection, response, and resolution of production incidents
    to restore service and prevent recurrence.

  incident_lifecycle:
    detection:
      - Monitor alerting systems
      - Receive incident reports
      - Validate incident severity

    triage:
      - Assess impact
      - Classify severity
      - Assign priority
      - Notify stakeholders

    response:
      - Assemble response team
      - Diagnose root cause
      - Implement mitigation
      - Communicate status

    resolution:
      - Verify service restored
      - Document resolution
      - Plan permanent fix
      - Update runbooks

    post_mortem:
      - Analyze incident
      - Identify improvements
      - Document learnings
      - Track action items

  severity_levels:
    critical: Service unavailable, immediate response
    high: Major functionality impacted, urgent response
    medium: Partial impact, standard response
    low: Minor issue, scheduled response

  constraints:
    - Critical incidents require immediate response
    - All incidents must be documented
    - Post-mortems required for critical/high severity
    - Resolution must be verified
