    Execution of deployment operations to move artifacts from
    development to production environments.

  deployment_process:
    pre_deployment:
      - Verify release artifacts
      - Confirm deployment window
      - Prepare rollback plan
      - Notify stakeholders

    deployment:
      - Execute deployment steps
      - Monitor deployment progress
      - Verify each stage
      - Document actions

    post_deployment:
      - Verify deployment success
      - Run smoke tests
      - Monitor for issues
      - Document completion

    rollback:
      - Detect deployment failure
      - Execute rollback plan
      - Verify rollback success
      - Document incident

  environment_types:
    development: Low risk, frequent changes
    staging: Medium risk, production-like
    production: High risk, controlled changes

  constraints:
    - Production changes require rollback plan
    - Must follow change management process
    - Deployment windows must be scheduled
    - All deployments must be documented

  compatible_archetypes:
    - Operator

  theoretical_basis:
    - Cybernetics: Deployment as controlled change
    - Complex Adaptive Systems: Production as live system
