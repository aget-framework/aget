  description: |
    Design of system architectures that balance requirements,
    constraints, and quality attributes.

  design_activities:
    requirements_analysis:
      - Identify functional requirements
      - Identify quality attributes
      - Understand constraints
      - Prioritize trade-offs

    architecture_definition:
      - Define system boundaries
      - Identify components
      - Specify interfaces
      - Document decisions

    evaluation:
      - Assess against requirements
      - Analyze trade-offs
      - Identify risks
      - Validate with stakeholders

    documentation:
      - Document architecture views
      - Record decisions (ADRs)
      - Explain trade-offs
      - Provide implementation guidance

  architecture_views:
    logical: Component structure and relationships
    deployment: Runtime environment mapping
    process: Dynamic behavior and concurrency
    data: Information structure and flow

  quality_attributes:
    runtime: [performance, availability, security]
    development: [maintainability, testability, modifiability]
    business: [time-to-market, cost, compliance]

  constraints:
    - Cannot approve architecture without documenting trade-offs
    - Major decisions require ADRs
    - Changes require impact analysis
    - Must consider implementation feasibility

  compatible_archetypes:
    - Architect
    - Developer

  theoretical_basis:
    - Cybernetics: Architecture as system control structure
    - Complex Adaptive Systems: Architecture for emergence
