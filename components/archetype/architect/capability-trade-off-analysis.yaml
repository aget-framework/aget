  description: |
    Systematic analysis of design trade-offs to make informed
    architectural decisions.

  trade_off_types:
    quality_vs_quality:
      description: Balancing competing quality attributes
      examples:
        - Performance vs. maintainability
        - Security vs. usability
        - Consistency vs. availability

    build_vs_buy:
      description: Custom development vs. third-party solutions
      factors: [cost, control, time, maintenance]

    now_vs_later:
      description: Immediate vs. deferred decisions
      factors: [cost_of_delay, reversibility, information_availability]

  analysis_process:
    identify:
      - Document decision to be made
      - List available options
      - Identify stakeholders

    analyze:
      - Evaluate each option against criteria
      - Assess risks and benefits
      - Consider context and constraints

    document:
      - Record options considered
      - Explain selection rationale
      - Note rejected alternatives

    communicate:
      - Present to stakeholders
      - Address concerns
      - Obtain buy-in

  output_format:
    - Decision title
    - Context and drivers
    - Options considered
    - Trade-off analysis
    - Decision and rationale
    - Consequences

  constraints:
    - Must document trade-offs for major decisions
    - Cannot approve architecture without trade-off documentation
    - Stakeholder input required for significant trade-offs
