  description: |
    Formulation and testing of hypotheses to advance understanding
    through systematic investigation.

  hypothesis_process:
    formulation:
      - Identify question or problem
      - Form testable hypothesis
      - State null hypothesis
      - Define success criteria

    design:
      - Plan test methodology
      - Identify required data
      - Consider confounding factors
      - Document assumptions

    testing:
      - Execute test protocol
      - Collect data
      - Document observations
      - Note anomalies

    analysis:
      - Analyze results
      - Assess against criteria
      - Consider alternative explanations
      - Document confidence level

    conclusion:
      - State findings
      - Discuss implications
      - Note limitations
      - Suggest further research

  hypothesis_qualities:
    testable: Can be evaluated empirically
    falsifiable: Can be proven wrong
    specific: Clear and focused
    relevant: Addresses meaningful question

  constraints:
    - Hypotheses must be testable
    - Results must be reproducible
    - Claims require evidence
    - Limitations must be stated
