    Creation of requirements using Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax
    (EARS) patterns. Ensures consistent, testable requirements.

  ears_patterns:
    ubiquitous:
      syntax: "The SYSTEM shall {action}"
      use_when: Always true, no conditions
      example: "The SYSTEM shall log all API requests"

    event_driven:
      syntax: "WHEN {trigger}, the SYSTEM shall {action}"
      use_when: Action triggered by specific event
      example: "WHEN User_Login_Succeeds, the SYSTEM shall create Session"

    state_driven:
      syntax: "WHILE {state}, the SYSTEM shall {action}"
      use_when: Action applies during state
      example: "WHILE Session_Active, the SYSTEM shall maintain Connection"

    optional:
      syntax: "WHERE {feature}, the SYSTEM shall {action}"
      use_when: Applies to optional features
      example: "WHERE Dark_Mode_Enabled, the SYSTEM shall apply Dark_Theme"

    conditional:
      syntax: "IF {condition}, the SYSTEM shall {action}"
      use_when: Action depends on condition
      example: "IF User_Is_Admin, the SYSTEM shall show Admin_Panel"

    complex:
      syntax: "WHILE {state}, WHEN {trigger}, the SYSTEM shall {action}"
      use_when: State and event combined
      example: "WHILE Editing, WHEN Save_Pressed, the SYSTEM shall persist Document"

  requirement_structure:
    - CAP_ID (capability identifier)
    - EARS pattern type
    - Requirement statement
    - Enforcement mechanism
    - Verification test reference

  constraints:
    - Must use valid EARS patterns
    - Each requirement must be testable
    - IDs must be unique and traceable
    - Must specify enforcement mechanism

  compatible_archetypes:
    - Spec_Engineer

  theoretical_basis:
    - BDI: Requirements as desired system behavior
    - Cybernetics: Requirements as specification
