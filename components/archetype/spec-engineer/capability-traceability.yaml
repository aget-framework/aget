  description: |
    Maintenance of traceability from requirements to implementation
    and tests. Enables impact analysis and coverage verification.

  traceability_tiers:
    tier_1_need_to_spec:
      from: Business/user needs
      to: Specification requirements
      artifacts: Vision docs, user stories

    tier_2_spec_to_design:
      from: Specification requirements
      to: Design decisions
      artifacts: Specs, ADRs

    tier_3_design_to_impl:
      from: Design decisions
      to: Implementation
      artifacts: ADRs, source code

    tier_4_impl_to_test:
      from: Implementation
      to: Test cases
      artifacts: Source code, tests

    tier_5_test_to_req:
      from: Test cases
      to: Requirements
      artifacts: Tests, specs

  traceability_matrix:
    structure:
      - Requirement ID
      - Specification reference
      - Implementation reference
      - Test reference
      - Status

  operations:
    link:
      - Create traceability link
      - Document relationship type
      - Validate bidirectionality

    verify:
      - Check coverage completeness
      - Identify orphan requirements
      - Detect broken links

    report:
      - Generate coverage report
      - Show traceability gaps
      - Highlight risks

  constraints:
    - All requirements must have implementation reference
    - All tests must trace to requirements
    - Coverage gaps must be documented
