    Systematic identification and resolution of software defects.
    Includes hypothesis formation, testing, and root cause analysis.

  debugging_process:
    reproduce:
      description: Confirm the issue exists
      steps:
        - Understand reported symptoms
        - Create minimal reproduction
        - Document reproduction steps

    isolate:
      description: Narrow down the cause
      steps:
        - Form hypothesis
        - Add diagnostic output
        - Binary search through code/commits

    identify:
      description: Find root cause
      steps:
        - Trace execution path
        - Examine state at failure point
        - Identify incorrect assumption

    fix:
      description: Resolve the issue
      steps:
        - Implement minimal fix
        - Verify fix resolves issue
        - Check for regression

    document:
      description: Record findings
      steps:
        - Document root cause
        - Note any related issues
        - Update tests to catch regression

  constraints:
    - Prefer minimal fixes
    - Avoid unrelated changes
    - Document non-obvious fixes
