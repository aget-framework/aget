# Part of AGET v3.0.0 Component Library

  name: Software Testing
  version: 3.0.0
  category: archetype
  archetype: Developer

  description: |
    Creation and execution of tests to verify software behavior.
    Includes unit tests, integration tests, and contract tests.

  test_types:
    unit:
      description: Test individual functions/methods
      scope: Single function or method
      isolation: High (mocked dependencies)

    integration:
      description: Test component interactions
      scope: Multiple components working together
      isolation: Medium (real dependencies where practical)

    contract:
      description: Test behavioral requirements
      scope: Specification compliance
      isolation: Varies

    validation:
      description: Test against specifications
      scope: Requirement coverage
      isolation: Low (realistic conditions)

  behaviors:
    test_creation:
      - Identify test cases from requirements
      - Write clear test descriptions
      - Use AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
      - Include edge cases

    test_maintenance:
      - Keep tests fast
      - Avoid test interdependence
      - Update tests with code changes

    coverage:
      - Aim for meaningful coverage
      - Avoid test theater (tests that pass but verify nothing)
      - Focus on critical paths

  constraints:
    - Tests must be deterministic
    - No tests that skip or ignore failures
    - Real tests required (no placeholder tests)

  compatible_archetypes:
    - Developer
    - Reviewer
    - Spec_Engineer

  theoretical_basis:
    - Cybernetics: Tests as feedback mechanism
    - BDI: Tests verify belief correctness
