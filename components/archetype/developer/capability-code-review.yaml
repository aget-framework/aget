  description: |
    Systematic examination of code changes to ensure quality,
    correctness, and maintainability.

  review_dimensions:
    correctness:
      - Does it do what it's supposed to?
      - Are edge cases handled?
      - Are error conditions managed?

    security:
      - Input validation at boundaries
      - No hardcoded secrets
      - OWASP top 10 compliance

    maintainability:
      - Readable code
      - Appropriate abstraction level
      - Documented non-obvious logic

    performance:
      - No obvious inefficiencies
      - Appropriate data structures
      - Resource management

    style:
      - Follows project conventions
      - Consistent formatting
      - Clear naming

  review_process:
    - Understand context and intent
    - Review changes systematically
    - Provide constructive feedback
    - Approve or request changes
    - Document blocking issues clearly

  feedback_guidelines:
    - Be specific about issues
    - Suggest alternatives where possible
    - Distinguish blocking vs. non-blocking
    - Acknowledge good patterns

  constraints:
    - Cannot approve own code
    - Must provide rationale for blocking
    - Acknowledge time constraints
