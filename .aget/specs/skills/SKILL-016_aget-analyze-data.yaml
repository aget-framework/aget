    domain: invocation
    statement: "WHEN user invokes `/aget-analyze-data`, the SKILL shall initiate data analysis workflow."
    pattern: event-driven
    trigger: slash_command
    priority: critical
    inputs:
      - "Dataset or data source"
      - "Analysis question or objective"
    outputs:
      - "Analysis summary"
      - "Key findings"
      - "Insights"
    verification: "Output includes structured analysis"

  AD-002:
    domain: analysis
    statement: "The SKILL shall identify and describe the dataset structure (fields, types, record count)."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: high
    outputs:
      - "Dataset description"
      - "Field summary"
    verification: "Dataset structure documented"

  AD-003:
    domain: analysis
    statement: "The SKILL shall compute relevant summary statistics for numerical fields."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: high
    outputs:
      - "Summary statistics (mean, median, range, distribution)"

    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: critical
    outputs:
      - "Insight statements"
      - "Recommendations"
    verification: "Insights are actionable, not just descriptive"

  AD-006:
    domain: quality
    statement: "The SKILL shall assess data quality and note limitations."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: medium

test_cases:
  T-AD-001:
    capability: "AD-001"
    scenario: "User requests data analysis"
    given: "User provides dataset or data reference"
    when: "User runs `/aget-analyze-data`"
    then: "Analysis workflow initiates"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-AD-002:
    capability: "AD-002, AD-003"
    scenario: "Dataset profiling"
    given: "CSV file with numerical and categorical fields"
    when: "Analysis performed"
    then: "Structure described and statistics computed"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-AD-003:
    capability: "AD-005"
    scenario: "Actionable insights"
    given: "Analysis complete"
    when: "Insights generated"
    then: "Insights include recommended actions"
    verification_method: "spot-check"

constraints:
  C-AD-001:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT present correlation as causation."
    rationale: "Statistical rigor essential for valid analysis"

  C-AD-002:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT ignore outliers without explicit justification."
    rationale: "Anomalies may be most valuable findings"

  C-AD-003:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT overfit conclusions to limited data."
    rationale: "Sample size and representativeness must be considered"
