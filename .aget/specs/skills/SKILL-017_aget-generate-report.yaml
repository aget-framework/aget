test_cases:
  T-GR-001:
    capability: "GR-001"
    scenario: "User requests report generation"
    given: "Analysis complete with findings"
    when: "User runs `/aget-generate-report`"
    then: "Formatted report created"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-GR-002:
    capability: "GR-002, GR-005"
    scenario: "Report structure"
    given: "Report generated"
    when: "Structure examined"
    then: "Executive summary, findings, and recommendations present"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-GR-003:
    capability: "GR-006"
    scenario: "Executive audience"
    given: "Audience specified as 'executive'"
    when: "Report generated"
    then: "High-level summary, strategic implications emphasized"

constraints:
  C-GR-001:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT include raw data dumps without context."
    rationale: "Reports must interpret data for the reader"

  C-GR-002:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT bury critical findings in appendices."
    rationale: "Key findings must be prominent"

  C-GR-003:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT generate reports exceeding 10 pages without sectioned navigation."
    rationale: "Long reports need structure for usability"
