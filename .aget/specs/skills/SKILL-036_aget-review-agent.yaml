test_cases:
  T-RA-001:
    capability: "RA-001"
    scenario: "User reviews agent"
    given: "Agent exists in fleet"
    when: "User runs `/aget-review-agent private-foo-aget`"
    then: "Review report produced"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-RA-002:
    capability: "RA-002, RA-003"
    scenario: "Health and conformance"
    given: "Agent with known conformance gaps"
    when: "Review performed"
    then: "Health and conformance reported"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-RA-003:
    capability: "RA-006"
    scenario: "Recommendations"
    given: "Agent with improvement opportunities"
    when: "Review complete"
    then: "Recommendations provided"
