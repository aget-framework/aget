capabilities:
  AR-001:
    domain: invocation
    statement: "WHEN user invokes `/aget-assess-risk`, the SKILL shall initiate risk assessment workflow."
    pattern: event-driven
    trigger: slash_command
    priority: critical
    inputs:
      - "Decision, action, or situation to assess"
    outputs:
      - "Risk identification"
      - "Likelihood assessment"
      - "Impact assessment"
      - "Mitigation options"
    verification: "Output includes structured risk assessment"

  AR-002:
    domain: analysis
    statement: "The SKILL shall identify risks using standard risk categories (operational, strategic, financial, compliance)."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: high
    inputs:
      - "Context description"
    outputs:
      - "Categorized risks"
    verification: "Risks assigned to standard categories"

  AR-003:
    domain: analysis
    statement: "The SKILL shall assess likelihood on a scale (Low, Medium, High, Critical)."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: high
    outputs:
      - "Likelihood rating per risk"
    verification: "Each risk has likelihood rating"

  AR-004:
    domain: analysis
    statement: "The SKILL shall assess impact on a scale (Low, Medium, High, Critical)."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: high
    outputs:
      - "Impact rating per risk"
    verification: "Each risk has impact rating"

  AR-005:
    domain: output
    statement: "The SKILL shall generate risk matrix visualization (likelihood × impact)."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: medium
    outputs:
      - "Risk matrix table"
    verification: "Matrix shows all identified risks"

  AR-006:
    domain: mitigation
    statement: "The SKILL shall propose mitigation options for high-priority risks."
    pattern: conditional
    trigger: "Risk rated High or Critical"
    priority: high
    outputs:
      - "Mitigation strategies"
    verification: "High/Critical risks have mitigation options"

test_cases:
  T-AR-001:
    capability: "AR-001"
    scenario: "User invokes risk assessment"
    given: "User has described a decision or action"
    when: "User runs `/aget-assess-risk`"
    then: "Risk assessment workflow initiates"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-AR-002:
    capability: "AR-002, AR-003, AR-004"
    scenario: "Complete risk analysis"
    given: "Project migration decision described"
    when: "Risk assessment performed"
    then: "Risks categorized with likelihood and impact ratings"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-AR-003:
    capability: "AR-006"
    scenario: "High-priority risk mitigation"
    given: "Risk rated as Critical"
    when: "Assessment completes"
    then: "Mitigation options proposed"
    verification_method: "spot-check"

constraints:
  C-AR-001:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT make decisions on behalf of the user."
    rationale: "Risk assessment informs decisions; final authority remains with user"

  C-AR-002:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT present speculation as fact."
    rationale: "Risk assessment must distinguish known facts from assumptions"

  C-AR-003:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT omit identified risks due to perceived sensitivity."
    rationale: "Complete risk picture essential for informed decisions"
