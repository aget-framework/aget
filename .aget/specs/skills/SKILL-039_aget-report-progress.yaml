  RP-007:
    domain: handoff
    statement: "WHEN handoff needed, the SKILL shall prepare handoff documentation."
    pattern: conditional
    trigger: "Session ending or task reassignment"
    priority: high
    outputs:
      - "Handoff document"
    verification: "Handoff enables continuation"

test_cases:
  T-RP-001:
    capability: "RP-001"
    scenario: "User requests progress"
    given: "Work in progress"
    when: "User runs `/aget-report-progress`"
    then: "Progress report generated"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-RP-002:
    capability: "RP-002, RP-003, RP-004"
    scenario: "Complete progress picture"
    given: "Task partially complete"
    when: "Report generated"
    then: "Percentage, completed, and remaining shown"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-RP-003:
    capability: "RP-007"
    scenario: "Handoff preparation"
    given: "Session ending with incomplete work"
    when: "Report generated"
    then: "Handoff document included"
    verification_method: "spot-check"

constraints:
  C-RP-001:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT overstate completion percentage."
    rationale: "Accurate progress essential for planning"

  C-RP-002:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT hide blockers."
    rationale: "Blockers need attention"

  C-RP-003:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT omit risks to protect optimistic view."
    rationale: "Honest risk reporting enables intervention"
