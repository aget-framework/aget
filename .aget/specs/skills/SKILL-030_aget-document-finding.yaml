test_cases:
  T-DF-001:
    capability: "DF-001"
    scenario: "User documents finding"
    given: "Research finding to document"
    when: "User runs `/aget-document-finding`"
    then: "Finding document created"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-DF-002:
    capability: "DF-002, DF-003"
    scenario: "Evidence documentation"
    given: "Finding with evidence"
    when: "Document created"
    then: "Finding statement and evidence present"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-DF-003:
    capability: "DF-006"
    scenario: "Limitations included"
    given: "Finding with limitations"
    when: "Document reviewed"
    then: "Limitations clearly stated"
    verification_method: "spot-check"

constraints:
  C-DF-001:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT document findings without evidence."
    rationale: "Findings must be supported"

  C-DF-002:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT overstate confidence level."
    rationale: "Epistemic humility required"

  C-DF-003:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT omit contradictory evidence."
    rationale: "Complete picture enables sound judgment"
