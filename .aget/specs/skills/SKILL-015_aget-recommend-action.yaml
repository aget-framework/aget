test_cases:
  T-RA-001:
    capability: "RA-001"
    scenario: "User requests recommendation"
    given: "User describes decision situation"
    when: "User runs `/aget-recommend-action`"
    then: "Structured recommendation generated"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-RA-002:
    capability: "RA-002"
    scenario: "Alternatives provided"
    given: "Recommendation requested"

    when: "Recommendation generated"
    then: "Assumptions and limitations stated"
    verification_method: "spot-check"

constraints:
  C-RA-001:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT present recommendations as commands."
