capabilities:
  ET-001:
    domain: invocation
    statement: "WHEN user invokes `/aget-execute-task`, the SKILL shall begin task execution."
    pattern: event-driven
    trigger: slash_command
    priority: critical
    inputs:
      - "Task definition or reference"
    outputs:
      - "Task execution"
      - "Deliverables"
    verification: "Task executed"

  ET-002:
    domain: validation
    statement: "The SKILL shall validate task definition before execution."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: high
    outputs:
      - "Validation result"
    verification: "Incomplete tasks flagged"

  ET-003:
    domain: execution
    statement: "The SKILL shall execute task steps sequentially."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: critical
    outputs:
      - "Step completion status"
    verification: "Steps execute in order"

  ET-004:
    domain: tracking
    statement: "The SKILL shall track and report progress."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: high
    outputs:
      - "Progress percentage"
      - "Current step"
    verification: "Progress visible"

  ET-005:
    domain: deliverables
    statement: "The SKILL shall produce specified deliverables."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: critical
    outputs:
      - "Deliverable artifacts"
    verification: "Deliverables match specification"

  ET-006:
    domain: blocking
    statement: "WHEN blocker encountered, the SKILL shall report and pause."
    pattern: conditional
    trigger: "Blocker encountered"
    priority: high
    outputs:
      - "Blocker description"
    verification: "Blockers not silently ignored"

test_cases:
  T-ET-001:
    capability: "ET-001"
    scenario: "User executes task"
    given: "Valid task definition"
    when: "User runs `/aget-execute-task`"
    then: "Task execution begins"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-ET-002:
    capability: "ET-003, ET-004"
    scenario: "Task with multiple steps"
    given: "Task with 5 steps"
    when: "Execution proceeds"
    then: "Progress reported at each step"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-ET-003:
    capability: "ET-006"
    scenario: "Blocker handling"
    given: "Step encounters blocker"
    when: "Blocker detected"
    then: "Execution pauses, blocker reported"
    verification_method: "manual"

constraints:
  C-ET-001:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT skip steps without explicit approval."
    rationale: "Task integrity requires step completion"

  C-ET-002:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT claim completion without deliverables."
    rationale: "Deliverables are proof of completion"

  C-ET-003:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT continue past blockers silently."
    rationale: "Blockers require human decision"
