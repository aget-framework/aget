test_cases:
  T-PE-001:
    capability: "PE-001"
    scenario: "User requests proposal"

    verification_method: "manual"

  T-PE-003:

constraints:
  C-PE-001:

    rationale: "Clear scope prevents scope creep"

  C-PE-003:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT define deliverables without acceptance criteria."
    rationale: "Criteria enable completion verification"
