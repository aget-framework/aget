capabilities:
  PF-001:
    domain: invocation
    statement: "WHEN user invokes `/aget-provide-feedback`, the SKILL shall generate structured feedback."
    pattern: event-driven
    trigger: slash_command
    priority: critical
    inputs:
      - "Work to provide feedback on"
    outputs:
      - "Structured feedback"
    verification: "Feedback generated"

  PF-002:
    domain: classification
    statement: "The SKILL shall classify feedback by severity (blocking, suggestion, nitpick, praise)."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: high
    outputs:
      - "Severity-tagged feedback"
    verification: "All items have severity"

  PF-003:
    domain: specificity
    statement: "The SKILL shall provide specific location for each feedback item."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: high
    outputs:
      - "Location references"
    verification: "Locations enable navigation"

    domain: actionability
    statement: "The SKILL shall include suggested resolution for issues."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: high
    outputs:
      - "Resolution suggestions"

    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: medium
    outputs:
      - "Positive feedback items"
    verification: "Strengths acknowledged"

  PF-006:
    domain: summary
    statement: "The SKILL shall provide summary with issue counts by severity."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: medium
    outputs:
      - "Summary statistics"
    verification: "Counts accurate"

test_cases:
  T-PF-001:
    capability: "PF-001"
    scenario: "User requests feedback"
    given: "Work product to review"
    when: "User runs `/aget-provide-feedback`"
    then: "Structured feedback generated"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-PF-002:
    capability: "PF-002, PF-003"
    scenario: "Classified feedback"
    given: "Issues found"
    when: "Feedback generated"
    then: "Severity and location included"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-PF-003:
    capability: "PF-005"
    scenario: "Balanced feedback"
    given: "Work has both issues and strengths"
    when: "Feedback provided"
    then: "Both included"
    verification_method: "spot-check"

constraints:
  C-PF-001:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT classify all feedback as blocking."
    rationale: "Severity inflation reduces effectiveness"

  C-PF-002:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT provide vague feedback."
    rationale: "Specific feedback enables action"

  C-PF-003:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT use harsh or personal language."
    rationale: "Constructive tone maintains collaboration"
