test_cases:
  T-EI-001:
    capability: "EI-001"
    scenario: "User escalates issue"
    given: "Issue exceeds supervisor scope"
    when: "User runs `/aget-escalate-issue`"
    then: "Escalation prepared"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-EI-002:
    capability: "EI-002"
    scenario: "Scope verification"
    given: "Issue within scope"
    when: "Escalation attempted"
    then: "User advised to handle locally"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-EI-003:
    capability: "EI-003, EI-004"
    scenario: "Complete escalation"
    given: "Escalation needed"
    when: "Escalation executed"
    then: "Context documented, target identified"
    verification_method: "spot-check"

constraints:
  C-EI-001:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT escalate issues within current authority."
    rationale: "Unnecessary escalation wastes resources"

  C-EI-002:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT escalate without documenting prior attempts."
    rationale: "Escalation requires proof of local effort"

  C-EI-003:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT set urgency inappropriately high."
    rationale: "Urgency inflation reduces effectiveness"
