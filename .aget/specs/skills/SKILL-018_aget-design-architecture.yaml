capabilities:
  DA-001:
    domain: invocation
    statement: "WHEN user invokes `/aget-design-architecture`, the SKILL shall initiate architecture design workflow."
    pattern: event-driven
    trigger: slash_command
    priority: critical
    inputs:
      - "Requirements or problem description"
      - "Constraints"
    outputs:
      - "Architecture overview"
      - "Component diagram"
      - "Relationship descriptions"
    verification: "Output includes architectural artifacts"

  DA-002:
    domain: decomposition
    statement: "The SKILL shall decompose the system into logical components."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: high
    outputs:
      - "Component list with responsibilities"
    verification: "Components have clear, single responsibilities"

  DA-003:
    domain: patterns
    statement: "The SKILL shall identify applicable architectural patterns."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: high
    outputs:
      - "Pattern recommendations (e.g., microservices, layered, event-driven)"
    verification: "Patterns match problem characteristics"

  DA-004:
    domain: relationships
    statement: "The SKILL shall define relationships and interfaces between components."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: high
    outputs:
      - "Interface definitions"
      - "Dependency diagram"
    verification: "All component interactions documented"

  DA-005:
    domain: quality
    statement: "The SKILL shall address key quality attributes (scalability, reliability, security)."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: high
    outputs:
      - "Quality attribute decisions"
    verification: "At least 3 quality attributes addressed"

  DA-006:
    domain: visualization
    statement: "The SKILL shall produce architecture diagrams in standard notation."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: medium
    outputs:
      - "ASCII or Mermaid diagrams"
    verification: "Diagrams follow consistent notation"

test_cases:
  T-DA-001:
    capability: "DA-001"
    scenario: "User requests architecture design"
    given: "User describes system requirements"
    when: "User runs `/aget-design-architecture`"
    then: "Architecture design workflow initiates"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-DA-002:
    capability: "DA-002, DA-003"
    scenario: "Component and pattern design"
    given: "Requirements analyzed"
    when: "Design produced"
    then: "Components and patterns documented"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-DA-003:
    capability: "DA-005"
    scenario: "Quality attributes"
    given: "Architecture designed"
    when: "Design reviewed"
    then: "Quality attributes explicitly addressed"
    verification_method: "spot-check"

constraints:
  C-DA-001:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT propose architecture without understanding requirements."
    rationale: "Architecture must serve requirements, not precede them"

  C-DA-002:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT introduce unnecessary complexity."
    rationale: "Simplest architecture meeting requirements is preferred"

  C-DA-003:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT ignore non-functional requirements."
    rationale: "Quality attributes are architectural drivers"
