capabilities:
  BF-001:
    domain: invocation
    statement: "WHEN user invokes `/aget-broadcast-fleet`, the SKILL shall prepare fleet communication."
    pattern: event-driven
    trigger: slash_command
    priority: critical
    inputs:
      - "Message type (announcement, directive, handoff)"
      - "Message content"
      - "Target agents (all, portfolio, specific)"
    outputs:
      - "Broadcast message"
      - "Delivery tracking"
    verification: "Broadcast prepared"

  BF-002:
    domain: targeting
    statement: "The SKILL shall resolve target agent list from specification."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: high
    outputs:
      - "Resolved agent list"
    verification: "Targets identified"

  BF-003:
    domain: formatting
    statement: "The SKILL shall format message according to type (announcement, directive, handoff)."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: high
    outputs:
      - "Formatted message"
    verification: "Format matches type"

  BF-004:
    domain: delivery
    statement: "The SKILL shall create handoff artifacts for each target agent."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: high
    outputs:
      - "Handoff artifacts"
    verification: "Artifacts created"

  BF-005:
    domain: tracking
    statement: "The SKILL shall track broadcast delivery status."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: medium
    outputs:
      - "Delivery status"
    verification: "Status tracked"

test_cases:
  T-BF-001:
    capability: "BF-001"
    scenario: "User broadcasts to fleet"
    given: "Fleet exists with multiple agents"
    when: "User runs `/aget-broadcast-fleet`"
    then: "Broadcast prepared"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-BF-002:
    capability: "BF-002"
    scenario: "Portfolio targeting"
    given: "Broadcast targets 'main' portfolio"
    when: "Targets resolved"
    then: "Only main portfolio agents listed"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-BF-003:
    capability: "BF-004"
    scenario: "Release handoff"
    given: "Handoff broadcast type"
    when: "Broadcast executed"
    then: "Handoff artifacts created per agent"
    verification_method: "spot-check"

constraints:
  C-BF-001:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT broadcast without target confirmation."
    rationale: "Accidental broadcasts waste agent attention"

  C-BF-002:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT modify agent configurations during broadcast."
    rationale: "Broadcast is communication, not configuration"

  C-BF-003:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT suppress delivery failures."
    rationale: "Failures must be visible"
