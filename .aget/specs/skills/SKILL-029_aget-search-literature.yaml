test_cases:
  T-SL-001:
    capability: "SL-001"
    scenario: "User requests literature search"
    given: "Research topic specified"
    when: "User runs `/aget-search-literature`"
    then: "Search performed"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-SL-002:
    capability: "SL-002"
    scenario: "KB priority"
    given: "Topic has KB matches"
    when: "Search performed"
    then: "KB results shown first"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-SL-003:
    capability: "SL-005"
    scenario: "Citation accuracy"
    given: "Sources found"
    when: "Results presented"
    then: "Citations verifiable"
    verification_method: "spot-check"

constraints:
  C-SL-001:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT fabricate sources or citations."
    rationale: "Research integrity essential"

  C-SL-002:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT present paraphrased content without attribution."
    rationale: "Plagiarism must be avoided"

  C-SL-003:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT claim comprehensive coverage without noting limitations."
    rationale: "Search scope must be acknowledged"
