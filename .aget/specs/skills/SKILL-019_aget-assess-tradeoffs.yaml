    priority: critical
    inputs:
      - "Competing options or concerns"
      - "Context and constraints"
    outputs:
      - "Trade-off analysis"
      - "Decision matrix"
      - "Recommendation"
    verification: "Output includes structured analysis"

  AT-002:
    domain: analysis
    statement: "The SKILL shall identify all competing quality attributes."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: high
    outputs:
      - "List of quality attributes in tension"
    verification: "Conflicting attributes explicitly named"

  AT-003:
    domain: analysis
    statement: "The SKILL shall evaluate each option against quality attributes."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: high
    outputs:
      - "Option evaluation matrix"
    verification: "Each option rated against each attribute"

  AT-004:
    domain: analysis
    statement: "The SKILL shall identify irreversible vs. reversible decisions."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: medium
    outputs:
      - "Decision reversibility assessment"
    verification: "Reversibility noted for each decision"

  AT-005:
    domain: output
    statement: "The SKILL shall provide recommendation with explicit rationale."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: high
    outputs:
      - "Recommendation"
      - "Rationale explaining trade-off resolution"
    verification: "Recommendation includes 'why'"

  AT-006:
    domain: documentation
    statement: "The SKILL shall document rejected alternatives for future reference."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: medium
    outputs:
      - "Rejected alternatives with reasons"
    verification: "Rejected options documented"

test_cases:
  T-AT-001:
    capability: "AT-001"
    scenario: "User requests trade-off analysis"
    given: "User describes competing concerns"
    when: "User runs `/aget-assess-tradeoffs`"
    then: "Trade-off analysis produced"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-AT-002:
    capability: "AT-002, AT-003"
    scenario: "Quality attribute analysis"
    given: "Options to compare"
    when: "Analysis performed"
    then: "Options evaluated against quality attributes"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-AT-003:
    capability: "AT-004"
    scenario: "Reversibility assessment"
    given: "Architectural decision"
    when: "Trade-off assessed"
    then: "Reversibility clearly stated"
    verification_method: "spot-check"

constraints:
  C-AT-001:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT pretend trade-offs don't exist."
    rationale: "Architectural honesty requires acknowledging costs"

  C-AT-002:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT recommend without explaining trade-off resolution."
    rationale: "Recommendations need justification"

  C-AT-003:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT treat all quality attributes as equally important."
    rationale: "Context determines attribute priority"
