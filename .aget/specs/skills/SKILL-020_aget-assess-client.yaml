capabilities:
  AC-001:
    domain: invocation
    statement: "WHEN user invokes `/aget-assess-client`, the SKILL shall initiate needs assessment."
    pattern: event-driven
    trigger: slash_command
    priority: critical
    inputs:
      - "Client context or description"
    outputs:
      - "Needs assessment document"
      - "Constraints inventory"
      - "Objectives list"
    verification: "Output includes structured assessment"

  AC-002:
    domain: discovery
    statement: "The SKILL shall identify explicit and implicit client needs."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: high
    outputs:
      - "Explicit needs (stated)"
      - "Implicit needs (inferred)"
    verification: "Both need types documented"

  AC-003:
    domain: discovery
    statement: "The SKILL shall identify constraints (budget, timeline, technical, organizational)."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: high
    outputs:
      - "Constraint categories with items"
    verification: "Multiple constraint types considered"

  AC-004:
    domain: analysis
    statement: "The SKILL shall prioritize needs using impact/urgency matrix."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: medium
    outputs:
      - "Prioritized needs list"
    verification: "Needs ranked by priority"

  AC-005:
    domain: output
    statement: "The SKILL shall identify gaps between current state and desired state."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: high
    outputs:
      - "Gap analysis"
    verification: "Gaps clearly articulated"

test_cases:
  T-AC-001:
    capability: "AC-001"
    scenario: "User requests client assessment"
    given: "User provides client context"
    when: "User runs `/aget-assess-client`"
    then: "Needs assessment produced"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-AC-002:
    capability: "AC-002, AC-003"
    scenario: "Comprehensive discovery"
    given: "Client description provided"
    when: "Assessment performed"
    then: "Needs and constraints identified"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-AC-003:
    capability: "AC-005"
    scenario: "Gap analysis"
    given: "Current and desired states described"
    when: "Assessment complete"
    then: "Gaps clearly documented"
    verification_method: "spot-check"

constraints:
  C-AC-001:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT assume client needs without verification."
    rationale: "Assumptions lead to scope mismatch"

  C-AC-002:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT ignore stated constraints."
    rationale: "Constraints bound the solution space"

  C-AC-003:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT conflate wants with needs."
    rationale: "Distinguishing wants from needs improves engagement focus"
