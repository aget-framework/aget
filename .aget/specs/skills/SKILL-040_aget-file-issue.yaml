# SKILL-040: aget-file-issue

## Description

File issues to appropriate repositories with L520 governance compliance. Ensures correct routing (private vs public) and content sanitization.

## Capabilities

| ID | Pattern | Statement |
|----|---------|-----------|
| CAP-SKILL-040-01 | ubiquitous | The SYSTEM shall determine agent type (private fleet vs public/remote) |
| CAP-SKILL-040-02 | ubiquitous | The SYSTEM shall route issues to correct destination based on agent type |
| CAP-SKILL-040-03 | conditional | IF agent is private fleet THEN the SYSTEM shall route to gmelli/aget-aget |
| CAP-SKILL-040-04 | conditional | IF agent is public/remote THEN the SYSTEM shall route to aget-framework/aget |
| CAP-SKILL-040-05 | ubiquitous | The SYSTEM shall sanitize content before filing to public repos |
| CAP-SKILL-040-06 | ubiquitous | The SYSTEM shall support issue types: enhancement, bug, feature |
| CAP-SKILL-040-07 | ubiquitous | The SYSTEM shall validate required fields before filing |

## Input Format

```
/aget-file-issue <type> [title]

Types:
- enhancement: Feature enhancement request
- bug: Bug report
- feature: New feature request
```

## Routing Logic

```
Agent Detection:
1. Check if path contains gmelli/ or private- prefix
2. Check .aget/version.json for fleet=private
3. Check git remote for gmelli/*

Routing:
- Private Fleet → gmelli/aget-aget
- Public/Remote → aget-framework/aget (with sanitization)
```

## Sanitization Patterns

Patterns to remove/redact before filing to public repos:

| Pattern | Replacement | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `private-*-aget` | `[PRIVATE-AGENT]` | `private-work-supervisor-AGET` |
| `private-*-AGET` | `[PRIVATE-AGENT]` | `private-aget-framework-AGET` |
| `gmelli/*` | `[INTERNAL-REPO]` | `gmelli/aget-aget` |
| Fleet size numbers | `[N agents]` | `28 agents in fleet` |
| Session references | `[SESSION]` | `SESSION_2026-01-11` |

## Constraints

| ID | Type | Statement |
|----|------|-----------|
| C1 | prohibitive | NEVER file to public repo from private agent without sanitization |
| C2 | prohibitive | NEVER include private agent names in public issues |
| C3 | prohibitive | NEVER include fleet size in public issues |
| C4 | prohibitive | NEVER include internal repo references in public issues |
| C5 | mandatory | ALWAYS use appropriate issue template |
| C6 | mandatory | ALWAYS validate destination before filing |

## Test Cases

| ID | Test | Expected |
|----|------|----------|
| T1 | Private agent files issue | Routes to gmelli/aget-aget |
| T2 | Public agent files issue | Routes to aget-framework/aget |
| T3 | Issue contains private-*-aget | Sanitized before public filing |
| T4 | Issue contains fleet size | Sanitized before public filing |
| T5 | Missing required fields | Validation error, no filing |

## Allowed Tools

- Bash (for gh issue create)
- Read (for agent detection)
- Grep (for sanitization patterns)

## Traceability

| Link | Reference |
|------|-----------|
| L-doc | L520 (Issue Governance Gap) |
| Spec | AGET_ISSUE_GOVERNANCE_SPEC |
| Requirements | R-ISSUE-001 through R-ISSUE-010 |
| Validators | validate_issue_destination.py, sanitize_issue_content.py |
