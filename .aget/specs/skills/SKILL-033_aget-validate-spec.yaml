      - "Traceability assessment"
    verification: "Missing links identified"

test_cases:
  T-VS-001:
    capability: "VS-001"
    scenario: "User validates specification"
    given: "Specification file exists"
    when: "User runs `/aget-validate-spec`"
    then: "Validation report produced"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-VS-002:
    capability: "VS-002, VS-005"
    scenario: "Format and completeness"
    given: "Spec with missing sections"
    when: "Validation performed"
    then: "Missing sections and format issues reported"
    verification_method: "automated"

  T-VS-003:
    capability: "VS-004"
    scenario: "Testability check"
    given: "Spec with vague requirements"
    when: "Validation performed"
    then: "Non-testable requirements flagged"
    verification_method: "manual"

constraints:
  C-VS-001:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT pass specifications with EARS violations."
    rationale: "Format consistency essential"

  C-VS-002:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT modify the specification during validation."
    rationale: "Validation is read-only"

  C-VS-003:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT skip testability assessment."
    rationale: "Untestable requirements are not requirements"
